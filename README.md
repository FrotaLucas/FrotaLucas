<p align="left">Creative | Spontaneous | Proactive | Problem-solving. Those are skill that better describe myself. <br>Despite graduating as a Chemical Engineer, I decided to pursue a career migration to the field of Software Development and reignite my passion for programming during my graduation. I firmly believe that possessing coding skills and understanding software functionality empowers professionals, enabling them to solve problems and liberate people from repetitive tasks. I am eager for new challenges, as I believe that professional growth occurs when we step out of our comfort zone.</p>
